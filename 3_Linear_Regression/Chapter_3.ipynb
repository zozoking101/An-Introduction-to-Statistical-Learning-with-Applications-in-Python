    " Recall the Advertising data from Chapter 2. Figure 2.1 displays sales (in thousands of units) for a particular product as a function of advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for TV, radio, and newspaper media. Suppose that in our role as statistical consultants we are asked to suggest,\n",
    " on the basis of this data, a marketing plan for next year that will result in high product sales. What information would be useful in order to provide such a recommendation? Here are a few important questions that we might seek to address:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. *Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?* Our first goal should be to determine whether the data provide evidence of an association between advertising expenditure and sales. If the evidence is weak, then one might argue that no money should be spent on advertising!\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. *How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?* Assuming that there is a relationship between advertising and sales, we would like to know the strength of this relationship. Does knowledge of the advertising budget provide a lot of information aboutproduct sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. *Which media are associated with sales?*\n",
    " Are all three media—TV, radio, and newspaper—associated with sales, or are just one or two of the media associated? To answer this question, we must find a way to separate out the individual contribution of each medium to sales when we have spent money on all three media.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. *How large is the association between each medium and sales?*\n",
    " For every dollar spent on advertising in a particular medium, by\n",
    " what amount will sales increase? How accurately can we predict this\n",
    " amount of increase?\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. *How accurately can we predict future sales?*\n",
    " For any given level of television, radio, or newspaper advertising, what is our prediction for sales, and what is the accuracy of this prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. *Is the relationship linear?*\n",
    " If there is approximately a straight-line relationship between advertising expenditure in the various media and sales, then linear regression is an appropriate tool. If not, then it may still be possible to transform the predictor or the response so that linear regression can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    " 7. *Is there synergy among the advertising media?*\n",
    " Perhaps spending $50,000 on television advertising and $50,000 on radio advertising is associated with higher sales than allocating $100,000 to either television or radio individually. In marketing, this is known as a synergy effect, while in statistics it is called an interaction effect.\n",

    "#### Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "*Simple linear regression* lives up to its name: it is a very straightforward approach for predicting a quantitative response $Y$ on the basis of a single predictor variable $X$. It assumes that there is approximately a linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$. Mathematically, we can write this linear relationship as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Y \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X.\n",
    "\\tag{3.1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "You might read “$\\approx$” as “is approximately modeled as”. We will sometimes describe (3.1) by saying that we are regressing $Y$ on $X$ (or $Y$ onto $X$).\n",
    "\n",
    " For example, X may represent TV advertising and Y may represent sales. Then we can regress sales onto TV by fitting the model\n",

    " \\begin{equation}\n",
    "sales \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x TV.\n",
    "\\tag{3.2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Equation 3.1, $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are two unknown constants that represent the *intercept* and *slope* terms in the linear model. Together, $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are known as the model *coefficients* or *parameters*. Once we have used our training data to produce estimates $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ for the model coefficients, we can predict future sales on the basis of a particular value of TV advertising by computing\n",

    "#### Estimating the Coefficients\n",

    "In practice, $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are unknown. So before we can use (3.1) to make predictions, we must use data to estimate the coefficients. Let\n",

In the *Advertising* example, this data set consists of the TV advertising budget and product sales in $n = 200$ different markets. (Recall that this data are displayed in Figure 2.1.) Our goal is to obtain coefficient estimates $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ such that the linear model (3.1) fits the available data well—that is, so that $y_i \\approx \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i$ for $i = 1, \\ldots, n$. In other words, we want to find an intercept $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and a slope $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ such that the resulting line is as close as possible to the $n = 200$ data points. There are a number of ways of measuring *closeness*. However, by far the most common approach involves minimizing the *least squares criterion*, and we take that approach in this chapter. Alternative approaches will be considered in Chapter 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i$ be the prediction for $Y$ based on the $i$th value of $X$. Then $e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i$ represents the $i$th *residual*—this is the difference between the $i$th observed response value and the $i$th response value that is predicted by our linear model. We define the *residual sum of squares* (RSS) as\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{RSS} = (y_1 - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_1)^2 + (y_2 - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_2)^2 + \\cdots + (y_n - \\hat{\\beta}_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_n)^2.\n",

In other words, according to this approximation, an additional \\$1000 spent on TV advertising is associated with selling approximately 47 additional units of the product. In Figure 3.2, we have computed RSS for a number of values of $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, using the advertising and sales as the response and $X$ as the predictor. In each plot, the red dot represents the pair of least squares estimates $(\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1)$ given by (3.4). These values clearly minimize the RSS.\n",

If $f$ is to be approximated by a linear function, then we can write this relationship as\n",

    "Here $\\beta_0$ is the intercept term—that is, the expected value of $Y$ when $X = 0$, and $\\beta_1$ quantifies the association between $X$ and $Y$. As we saw in the previous section, we use data to produce estimates of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ via the *least squares* approach. If the true relationship is probably not linear, there may be relationships not captured by this model, and there may be measurement error. We typically assume that the error term is independent of $X$.\n",
