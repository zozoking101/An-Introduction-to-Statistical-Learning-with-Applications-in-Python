As with the tuning parameters that we have seen throughout this book, $ C $ controls the bias-variance trade-off of the statistical learning technique. When $ C $ is small, we seek narrow margins that are rarely violated; this amounts to a classifier that is highly fit to the data, which may have low bias but high variance. On the other hand, when $ C $ is larger, the margin is wider and we allow more violations to it; this amounts to fitting the data less hard and obtaining a classifier that is potentially more biased but may have lower variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization problem (9.12)–(9.15) has a very interesting property: it turns out that only observations that either lie on the margin or that violate the margin will affect the hyperplane, and hence the classifier obtained. In other words, an observation that lies strictly on the correct side of the margin does not affect the support vector classifier! Changing the position of that observation would not change the classifier at all, provided that its position remains on the correct side of the margin. Observations that lie directly on the margin, or on the wrong side of the margin for their class, are known as support vectors. These observations do affect the support vector classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that only support vectors affect the classifier is in line with our previous assertion that $ C $ controls the bias-variance trade-off of the support vector classifier. When the tuning parameter $ C $ is large, then the margin is wide, many observations violate the margin, and so there are many support vectors. In this case, many observations are involved in determining the hyperplane. The top left panel in Figure 9.7 illustrates this setting: this classifier has low variance (since many observations are support vectors) but potentially high bias. In contrast, if $ C $ is small, then there will be fewer support vectors and hence the resulting classifier will have low bias but high variance. The bottom right panel in Figure 9.7 illustrates this setting, with only eight support vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the support vector classifier’s decision rule is based only on a potentially small subset of the training observations (the support vectors) means that it is quite robust to the behavior of observations that are far away from the hyperplane. This property is distinct from some of the other classification methods that we have seen in preceding chapters,\n",
    "such as linear discriminant analysis. Recall that the LDA classification rule\n",
    "depends on the mean of all of the observations within each class, as well as\n",
    "the within-class covariance matrix computed using all of the observations.\n",
    "In contrast, logistic regression, unlike LDA, has very low sensitivity to ob\n",
    "servations far from the decision boundary. In fact we will see in Section 9.5\n",
    "that the support vector classifier and logistic regression are closely related."

    "The support vector classifier is a natural approach for classification in the two-class setting, if the boundary between the two classes is linear. However, in practice we are sometimes faced with non-linear class boundaries. For instance, consider the data in the left-hand panel of Figure 9.8. It is clear that a support vector classifier or any linear classifier will perform poorly here. Indeed, the support vector classifier shown in the right-hand panel of Figure 9.8 is useless here.\n",

    "Why does this lead to a non-linear decision boundary? In the enlarged feature space, the decision boundary that results from (9.16) is in fact linear. But in the original feature space, the decision boundary is of the form $ q(x) = 0 $, where $ q $ is a quadratic polynomial, and its solutions are generally non-linear. One might additionally want to enlarge the feature space with higher-order polynomial terms, or with interaction terms of the form $ X_j X_j $ for $ j = j $. Alternatively, other functions of the predictors could be considered rather than polynomials. It is not hard to see that there are many possible ways to enlarge the feature space, and that unless we are careful, we could end up with a huge number of features. Then computations would become unmanageable. The support vector machine, which we present next, allows us to enlarge the feature space used by the support vector classifier in a way that leads to efficient computations.\n"
