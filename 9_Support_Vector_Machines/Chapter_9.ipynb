As with the tuning parameters that we have seen throughout this book, $ C $ controls the bias-variance trade-off of the statistical learning technique. When $ C $ is small, we seek narrow margins that are rarely violated; this amounts to a classifier that is highly fit to the data, which may have low bias but high variance. On the other hand, when $ C $ is larger, the margin is wider and we allow more violations to it; this amounts to fitting the data less hard and obtaining a classifier that is potentially more biased but may have lower variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization problem (9.12)–(9.15) has a very interesting property: it turns out that only observations that either lie on the margin or that violate the margin will affect the hyperplane, and hence the classifier obtained. In other words, an observation that lies strictly on the correct side of the margin does not affect the support vector classifier! Changing the position of that observation would not change the classifier at all, provided that its position remains on the correct side of the margin. Observations that lie directly on the margin, or on the wrong side of the margin for their class, are known as support vectors. These observations do affect the support vector classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that only support vectors affect the classifier is in line with our previous assertion that $ C $ controls the bias-variance trade-off of the support vector classifier. When the tuning parameter $ C $ is large, then the margin is wide, many observations violate the margin, and so there are many support vectors. In this case, many observations are involved in determining the hyperplane. The top left panel in Figure 9.7 illustrates this setting: this classifier has low variance (since many observations are support vectors) but potentially high bias. In contrast, if $ C $ is small, then there will be fewer support vectors and hence the resulting classifier will have low bias but high variance. The bottom right panel in Figure 9.7 illustrates this setting, with only eight support vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the support vector classifier’s decision rule is based only on a potentially small subset of the training observations (the support vectors) means that it is quite robust to the behavior of observations that are far away from the hyperplane. This property is distinct from some of the other classification methods that we have seen in preceding chapters,\n",
    "such as linear discriminant analysis. Recall that the LDA classification rule\n",
    "depends on the mean of all of the observations within each class, as well as\n",
    "the within-class covariance matrix computed using all of the observations.\n",
    "In contrast, logistic regression, unlike LDA, has very low sensitivity to ob\n",
    "servations far from the decision boundary. In fact we will see in Section 9.5\n",

When the classes are well separated, SVMs tend to behave better than logistic regression; in more overlapping regimes, logistic regression is often preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the support vector classifier and SVM were first introduced, it was thought that the tuning parameter $ C $ in (9.15) was an unimportant “nuisance” parameter that could be set to some default value, like 1. However, the “Loss + Penalty” formulation (9.25) for the support vector classifier indicates that this is not the case. The choice of tuning parameter is very important and determines the extent to which the model underfits or overfits the data, as illustrated, for example, in Figure 9.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have established that the support vector classifier is closely related to logistic regression and other preexisting statistical methods. Is the SVM unique in its use of kernels to enlarge the feature space to accommodate non-linear class boundaries? The answer to this question is “no”. We could just as well perform logistic regression or many of the other classification methods seen in this book using non-linear kernels; this is closely related to some of the non-linear approaches seen in Chapter 7. However, for historical reasons, the use of non-linear kernels is much more widespread in the context of SVMs than in the context of logistic regression or other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we have not addressed it here, there is in fact an extension of the SVM for regression (i.e., for a quantitative rather than a qualitative response), called support vector regression. In Chapter 3, we saw that least squares regression seeks coefficients $ \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_p $ such that the sum of squared residuals is as small as possible. (Recall from Chapter 3 that residuals are defined as $ y_i - \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_{ip} \\right) $.) Support vector regression instead seeks coefficients that minimize a different type of loss, where only residuals larger in absolute value than some positive constant contribute to the loss function. This is an extension of the margin used in support vector classifiers to the regression setting."
