We have used $2 \\times 2$ as an example; in general, convolution filters are small $l_1 \\times l_2$ arrays, with $l_1$ and $l_2$ small positive integers that are not necessarily equal.\n",

Each convolution filter is a $15 \\times 15$ image containing mostly zeros (black), with a narrow strip of ones (white) oriented either vertically or horizontally within the image. When each filter is convolved with the image of the tiger, areas of the tiger that resemble the filter (i.e., that have either horizontal or vertical stripes or edges) are given large values, and areas of the tiger that do not resemble the feature are given small values. The convolved images are displayed on the right-hand side. We see that the horizontal stripe filter picks out horizontal stripes and edges in the original image, whereas the vertical stripe filter picks out vertical stripes and edges in the original image."

This number also defines the number of channels in the resulting three-dimensional feature map.

    "An additional important trick used with image modeling is data augmentation. Essentially, each training image is replicated many times, with each replicate randomly distorted in a natural way such that human recognition is unaffected. Figure 10.9 shows some examples. Typical distortions are zoom, horizontal and vertical shift, shear, small rotations, and in this case horizontal flips. At face value this is a way of increasing the training set considerably with somewhat different examples, and thus protects against overfitting. In fact we can see this as a form of regularization: we build a cloud of images around each original image, all with the same label. This kind of fattening of the data is similar in spirit to ridge regularization. We will see in Section 10.7.2 that the stochastic gradient descent algorithms for fitting deep learning models repeatedly process randomly selected batches of, say, 128 training images at a time. This works hand-in-glove with augmentation, because we can distort each image in the batch on the fly, and hence do not have to store all the new images."

This means that rather than representing each word by a binary vector with 9,999 zeros and a single one in some position, we will represent it instead by a set of $m$ real numbers, none of which are typically zero.

The idea is that the positions of words in the embedding space preserve semantic meaning; e.g. synonyms should appear near each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, so good. Each document is now represented as a sequence of m vectors that represents the sequence of words. The next step is to limit each document to the last L words. Documents that are shorter than L get padded with zeros upfront. So now each document is represented by a series consisting of L vectors $X = \\{X_1, X_2, ..., X_L\\}$, and each $X$ in the sequence has m components.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now use the RNN structure in Figure 10.12. The training corpus consists of n separate series (documents) of length L, each of which gets processed sequentially from left to right. In the process, a parallel series of hidden activation vectors $A_t,\\, t=1,\\ldots,L$ is created as in (10.16) for each document. $A_t$ feeds into the output layer to produce the evolving prediction $O_t$. We use the final value $O_L$ to predict the response: the sentiment of the review."

Two tracks of hidden-layer activations are maintained, so that when the activation $A_t$ is computed, it gets input from hidden units both further back in time, and closer in time — a so-called LSTM RNN. With long sequences, this LSTM RNN overcomes the problem of early signals being washed out by the time they get propagated through the chain to the final activation vector $A_L$.\n",

The series exhibit auto-correlation — in this case values nearby in time tend to be similar to each other. This distinguishes time series from other data sets we have encountered, in which observations can be assumed to be independent of each other. To be clear, consider pairs of observations $(v_t, v_{t-\\ell})$, a lag of $\\ell$ days apart. If we take all such pairs in the $v_t$ series and compute their correlation coefficient, this gives the autocorrelation at lag $\\ell$.

Also, when $n$ is large, instead of summing (10.29)–(10.30) over all $n$ observations, we can sample a small fraction or minibatch of them each time we compute a gradient step. This process is known as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and is the state of the art for learning deep neural networks.

For this network, 20% of the 60,000 training observations were used as a validation set in order to determine when training should stop.

Inspired by random forests (Section 8.2), the idea is to randomly remove a fraction of the units in a layer when fitting the model. Figure 10.19 illustrates this. This is done separately each time a training observation is processed. The surviving units stand in for those missing, and their weights are scaled up by a factor of $1/(1 − \\phi)$ to compensate.

    "Throughout this book, we have repeatedly discussed the bias-variance trade off, first presented in Section 2.2.2. This trade-off indicates that statistical learning methods tend to perform the best, in terms of test-set error, for an intermediate level of model complexity. In particular, if we plot “flexibility” on the x-axis and error on the y-axis, then we generally expect to see that test error has a U-shape, whereas training error decreases monotonically. Two “typical” examples of this behavior can be seen in the right-hand panel of Figure 2.9 on page 29, and in Figure 2.17 on page 39. One implication of the bias-variance trade-off is that it is generally not a good idea to interpolate the training data — that is, to get zero training error — since that will often result in very high test error.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it turns out that in certain specific settings it can be possible for a statistical learning method that interpolates the training data to perform well — or at least, better than a slightly less complex model that does not quite interpolate the data. This phenomenon is known as double descent, and is displayed in Figure 10.20. “Double descent” gets its name from the fact that the test error has a U-shape before the interpolation threshold is reached, and then it descends again (for a while, at least) as an increasingly flexible model is fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now describe the set-up that resulted in Figure 10.20. We simulated n = 20 observations from the model\n",
    "\n",

    "Y = \\sin(X) + \\epsilon,\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "We then fit a natural spline to the data, as described in Section 7.4, with d degrees of freedom.22 Recall from Section 7.4 that fitting a natural spline with d degrees of freedom amounts to fitting a least-squares regression of the response onto a set of d basis functions. The upper-left panel of Figure 10.21 shows the data, the true function $f(X)$, and $\\hat f_8(X)$, the fitted natural spline with $d = 8$ degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we fit a natural spline with $d = 20$ degrees of freedom. Since $n = 20$, this means that $n = d$, and we have zero training error; in other words, we have interpolated the training data! We can see from the top-right panel of Figure 10.21 that $\\hat f_{20}(X)$ makes wild excursions, and hence the test error will be large.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now continue to fit natural splines to the data, with increasing values of $d$. For $d > 20$, the least squares regression of $Y$ onto $d$ basis functions is not unique: there are an infinite number of least squares coefficient estimates that achieve zero error. To select among them, we choose the one with the smallest sum of squared coefficients, $\\sum_{j=1}^d \\hat\\beta_j^2$. This is known as the minimum-norm solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two lower panels of Figure 10.21 show the minimum-norm natural spline fits with $d = 42$ and $d = 80$ degrees of freedom. Incredibly, $\\hat f_{42}(X)$ is quite a bit less wild than $\\hat f_{20}(X)$, even though it makes use of more degrees of freedom. And $\\hat f_{80}(X)$ is not much different. How can this be? Essentially, $\\hat f_{20}(X)$ is very wild because there is just a single way to interpolate $n = 20$ observations using $d = 20$ basis functions, and that single way results in a somewhat extreme fitted function. By contrast, there are an infinite number of ways to interpolate n = 20 observations using d = 42 or d = 80 basis functions, and the smoothest of them — that is, the minimum-norm solution — is much less wild than $\\hat f_{20}(X)$!\n",
    "\n",
    "In Figure 10.20, we display the training error and test error associated with $\\hat f_d(X)$, for a range of values of the degrees of freedom $d$. We see that the training error drops to zero once $d = 20$ and beyond; i.e. once the interpolation threshold is reached. By contrast, the test error shows a U shape for $d \\le 20$, grows extremely large around $d = 20$, and then shows a second region of descent for $d>20$. For this example the signal-to-noise ratio — $\\mathrm{Var}(f(X))/\\sigma^2$ — is 5.9, which is quite high (the data points are close to the true curve). So an estimate that interpolates the data and does not wander too far in between the observed data points will likely do well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Figures 10.20 and 10.21, we have illustrated the double descent phenomenon in a simple one-dimensional setting using natural splines. However, it turns out that the same phenomenon can arise for deep learning. Basically, when we fit neural networks with a huge number of parameters, we are sometimes able to get good results with zero training error. This is particularly true in problems with high signal-to-noise ratio, such as natural image recognition and language translation, for example. This is because the techniques used to fit neural networks, including stochastic gradient descent, naturally lend themselves to selecting a “smooth” interpolating model that has good test-set performance on these kinds of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some points are worth emphasizing:\n",
    "- The double-descent phenomenon does not contradict the bias-variance trade-off, as presented in Section 2.2.2. Rather, the double-descent curve seen in the right-hand side of Figure 10.20 is a consequence of the fact that the x-axis displays the number of spline basis functions used, which does not properly capture the true “flexibility” of models that interpolate the training data. Stated another way, in this example, the minimum-norm natural spline with $d = 42$ has lower variance than the natural spline with $d = 20$.\n",
    "- Most of the statistical learning methods seen in this book do not exhibit double descent. For instance, regularization approaches typically do not interpolate the training data, and thus double descent does not occur. This is not a drawback of regularized methods: they can give great results without interpolating the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, in the examples here, if we had fit the natural splines using ridge regression with an appropriately-chosen penalty rather than least squares, then we would not have seen double descent, and in fact would have obtained better test error results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Chapter 9, we saw that maximal margin classifiers and SVMs that have zero training error nonetheless often achieve very good test error. This is in part because those methods seek smooth minimum norm solutions. This is similar to the fact that the minimum-norm natural spline can give good results with zero training error.\n",
    "- The double-descent phenomenon has been used by the machine learning community to explain the successful practice of using an overparametrized neural network (many layers, and many hidden units), and then fitting all the way to zero training error. However, fitting to zero error is not always optimal, and whether it is advisable depends on the signal-to-noise ratio. For instance, we may use ridge regularization to avoid overfitting a neural network, as in (10.31). In this case, provided that we use an appropriate choice for the tuning parameter \\(\\Lambda\\), we will never interpolate the training data, and thus will not see the double descent phenomenon. Nonetheless we can get very good test-set performance, likely much better than we would have achieved had we interpolated the training data. Early stopping during stochastic gradient descent can also serve as a form of regularization that prevents us from interpolating the training data, while still getting very good results on test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize: though double descent can sometimes occur in neural networks, we typically do not want to rely on this behavior. Moreover, it is important to remember that the bias-variance trade-off always holds (though it is possible that test error as a function of flexibility may not exhibit a U-shape, depending on how we have parametrized the notion of “flexibility” on the x-axis).\n"
