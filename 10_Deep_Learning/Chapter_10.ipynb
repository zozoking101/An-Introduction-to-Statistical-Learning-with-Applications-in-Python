    "\n",
    "Neural networks rose to fame in the late 1980s. There was a lot of excite\n",
    "ment and a certain amount of hype associated with this approach, and they\n",
    "were the impetus for the popular Neural Information Processing Systems\n",
    "meetings (NeurIPS, formerly NIPS) held every year, typically in exotic\n",
    "places like ski resorts. This was followed by a synthesis stage, where the\n",
    "properties of neural networks were analyzed by machine learners, math\n",
    "ematicians and statisticians; algorithms were improved, and the method\n",
    "ology stabilized. Then along came SVMs, boosting, and random forests,\n",
    "and neural networks fell somewhat from favor. Part of the reason was that\n",
    "neural networks required a lot of tinkering, while the new methods were\n",
    "more automatic. Also, on many problems the new methods outperformed\n",
    "poorly-trained neural networks. This was the status quo for the first decade\n",
    "in the new millennium.\n",

    "All the while, though, a core group of neural-network enthusiasts were\n",
    "pushing their technology harder on ever-larger computing architectures and\n",

    "learning, with new architectures, additional bells and whistles, and a string\n",
    "of success stories on some niche problems such as image and video classifi\n",
    "cation, speech and text modeling. Many in the field believe that the major\n",
    "reason for these successes is the availability of ever-larger training datasets,\n",
    "made possible by the wide-scale use of digitization in science and industry.\n",

    "current neural networks (RNNs) for time series and other sequences. We will also demonstrate these models using the Python torch package, along\n",
    "with a number of helper packages.\n",
