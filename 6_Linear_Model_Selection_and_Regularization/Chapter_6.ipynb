The $ C_p $ statistic adds a penalty term involving $ d $ in order to adjust for the number of predictors  in the model increases; this is intended to adjust for the corresponding decrease in training RSS. Based on the scope of this book, one can show that if $ \\hat{\\sigma}^2 $ in (6.2), then $ C_p $ is an unbiased estimate of test MSE. As a consequence, the $ C_p $ statistic tends to take a larger value in the model selected with the lowest $ C_p $ value.

Since $ \\log n > 2 $ for any $ n > 7 $, the BIC statistic generally places a heavier penalty on models with many variables, and hence reveals in the selection of smaller models than $ C_p $. In Figure 6.2, we see that the direct task decider is a single model that contains only the four predictors income, lint, age, and assertion.

The notation $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$ denotes the 2 norm (pronounced “ell 2”) of a vector, and is defined as $\\|\\beta\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j^2}$. It measures the distance of $\\beta$ from zero. As $\\lambda$ increases, the 2 norm of $\\hat{R}$ will always decrease, and so will $\\hat{R}^2/\\hat{2}$. The latter quantity ranges from 1 (when $\\lambda=0$, in which case the ridge regression coefficient estimate is the same as the least squares estimate, and so their 2 norms are the same) to 0 (when $\\lambda = \\infty$, in which case the ridge regression coefficient estimate is a vector of zeros, with 2 norm equal to zero).

    "The standard least squares coefficient estimates discussed in Chapter 3 are scale equivariant: multiplying $X_j$ by a constant $c$ simply leads to a scaling of the least squares coefficient estimates by a factor of $1/c$. In other words, regardless of how the jth predictor is scaled, $X_j \\hat{\\beta}_j$ will remain the same. In contrast, the ridge regression coefficient estimates can change substantially when multiplying a given predictor by a constant. For instance, consider the income variable, which is measured in dollars. One could reasonably have measured income in thousands of dollars, which would result in a reduction in the observed values of income by a factor of 1,000. Now due to the sum of squared coefficients term in the ridge regression formulation (6.5), such a change in scale will not simply cause the ridge regression coefficient estimate for income to change by a factor of 1,000. In other words, $X_j \\hat{R}_j$ will depend not only on the value of $\\lambda$, but also on the scaling of the jth predictor. In fact, the value of $X_j \\hat{R}_j$ may even depend on the scaling of the other predictors!

In Figure 6.4, the y-axis displays the standardized ridge regression coefficient estimates—that is, the coefficient estimates that result from performing ridge regression using standardized predictors.\n",

    "Why Does Ridge Regression Improve Over Least Squares?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression’s advantage over least squares is rooted in the bias-variance trade-off. As $\\lambda$ increases, the flexibility of the ridge regression fit decreases, leading to decreased variance but increased bias. This is illustrated in the left-hand panel of Figure 6.5, using a simulated data set containing $p = 45$ predictors and $n = 50$ observations. The green curve in the left-hand panel of Figure 6.5 displays the variance of the ridge regression predictions as a function of $\\lambda$. At the least squares coefficient estimates, which correspond to ridge regression with $\\lambda = 0$, the variance is high but there is no bias. But as $\\lambda$ increases, the shrinkage of the ridge coefficient estimates leads to a substantial reduction in the variance of the predictions, at the expense of a slight increase in bias. Recall that the least mean squared error (MSE), plotted in bias-variance bias, is closely related to the variance plus the squared bias. For values of $\\lambda$ that are not too small, the variance generally remains very low, as shown in the figure, plotted in black. However, as $\\lambda$ increases from 0 to 10. Beyond this point, the decrease in variance is no longer sufficient to offset the increased bias, and the MSE can begin to be significantly underestimated, resulting in a large increase in the bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum MSE is achieved at and around the value of $\\lambda$ that results in the smallest MSE associated with the least squares fit, when using the same hyperparameter that will yield the best fit for any model designed for use with $\\lambda$. However, for an inflexible estimator, the MSE is considerably higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, as the number of observations increases, the ridge regression estimates become more stable against the errors in the left-hand curve; however, the fitted values may still have high variance. This means that while ridge regression can improve the fitted values' stability by controlling their variance, the coefficients of the variables in the model may be increasingly biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Figure 6.5, the least squares estimates continue to outperform ridge regression predictions, even when $\\lambda > 0$, because the least squares estimation can still perform well by trading off a small increase in bias for a large decrease in variance. Hence, ridge regression works best in situations\n",
    "where the least squares estimates have high variance.\n",
    "Ridge regression also has substantial computational advantages over best\n",
    "subset selection, which requires searching through $2^p$ models. As we dis\n",
    "cussed previously, even for moderate values of $p$, such a search can be\n",
    "computationally infeasible. In contrast, for any fixed value of $\\lambda$, ridge re\n",

    "PCA is a technique for reducing the dimension of an $n \\times p$ data matrix $X$. The first principal component direction of the data is that along which the observations vary the most. For instance, consider Figure 6.14, which shows population size ($pop$) in tens of thousands of people, and ad spending for a particular company ($ad$) in thousands of dollars, for 100 cities. The green solid line represents the first principal component direction of the data. We can see by eye that this is the direction along which there is the greatest variability in the data. That is, if we projected the 100 observations onto this line (as shown in the left-hand panel of Figure 6.15), then the resulting projected observations would have the largest possible variance; projecting the observations onto any other line would yield projected observations with lower variance. Projecting a point onto a line simply involves finding the location on the line which is closest to the point.\n",

The idea is that out of every possible linear combination of $pop$ and $ad$ such that $\\gamma_{11}^2 + \\gamma_{21}^2 = 1$, this particular linear combination yields the highest variance: i.e., this is the linear combination for which \n",

In (6.19), the two loadings are both positive and have similar size, and so $Z_1$ is almost an average of the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $n = 100$, $pop$ and $ad$ are vectors of length 100, and so is $Z_1$ in (6.19). For instance,\n",

    "\n",
    "There is also another interpretation of PCA: the first principal component vector defines the line that is as close as possible to the data. For instance, in Figure 6.14, the first principal component line minimizes the sum of the squared perpendicular distances between each point and the line. These distances are plotted as dashed line segments in the left-hand panel of Figure 6.15, in which the crosses represent the projection of each point onto the first principal component line. The first principal component has been chosen so that the projected observations are as close as possible to the original observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the right-hand panel of Figure 6.15, the left-hand panel has been rotated so that the first principal component direction coincides with the x-axis. It is possible to show that the first principal component score for the $i$th observation, given in (6.20), is the distance in the x-direction of the $i$th cross from zero. So for example, the point in the bottom-left corner of the left-hand panel of Figure 6.15 has a large negative principal component score, $z_{i1} = -26.1$, while the point in the top-right corner has a large positive score, $z_{i1} = 18.7$. These scores can be computed directly using (6.20).\n",

    "We can think of the values of the principal component $Z_1$ as single number summaries of the joint $pop$ and $ad$ budgets for each location. In this example, if $z_{i1} = 0.839 (pop_i - \\bar{pop}) + 0.544 (ad_i - \\bar{ad}) < 0$, then this indicates a city with below-average population size and below-average ad spending. A positive score suggests the opposite. How well can a single number represent both $pop$ and $ad$? In this case, Figure 6.14 indicates that $pop$ and $ad$ have approximately a linear relationship, and so we might expect that a single-number summary will work well. Figure 6.16 displays $z_{i1}$ versus both $pop$ and $ad$. The plots show a strong relationship between the first principal component and the two features. In other words, the first principal component appears to capture most of the information contained in the $pop$ and $ad$ predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have concentrated on the first principal component. In general, one can construct up to $p$ distinct principal components. The second principal component $Z_2$ is a linear combination of the variables that is uncorrelated with $Z_1$, and has largest variance subject to this constraint. The second principal component direction is illustrated as a dashed blue line in Figure 6.14. It turns out that the zero correlation condition of $Z_1$ with $Z_2$ is equivalent to the condition that the direction must be perpendicular, or orthogonal, to the first principal component direction. The second principal component is given by the formula\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the advertising data has two predictors, the first two principal components contain all of the information that is in $pop$ and $ad$. However, by construction, the first component will contain the most information. Consider, for example, the much larger variability of $z_{i1}$ (the x-axis) versus $z_{i2}$ (the y-axis) in the right-hand panel of Figure 6.15. The fact that the second principal component scores are much closer to zero indicates that this component captures far less information. As another illustration, Figure 6.17 displays $z_{i2}$ versus $pop$ and $ad$. There is little relationship between the second principal component and these two predictors, again suggesting that in this case, one only needs the first principal component in order to accurately represent the $pop$ and $ad$ budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "With two-dimensional data, such as in our advertising example, we can construct at most two principal components. However, if we had other predictors, such as population age, income level, education, and so forth, then additional components could be constructed. They would successively maximize variance, subject to the constraint of being uncorrelated with the preceding components.\n",

    "The principal components regression (PCR) approach involves constructing the first $M$ principal components, $Z_1, \\ldots, Z_M$, and then using these components as the predictors in a linear regression model that is fit using least squares. The key idea is that often a small number of principal components suffice to explain most of the variability in the data, as well as the relationship with the response. In other words, we assume that the directions in which $X_1, \\ldots, X_p$ show the most variation are the directions that are associated with $Y$. While this assumption is not guaranteed to be true, it often turns out to be a reasonable enough approximation to give good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the assumption underlying PCR holds, then fitting a least squares model to $Z_1, \\ldots, Z_M$ will lead to better results than fitting a least squares model to $X_1, \\ldots, X_p$, since most or all of the information in the data that relates to the response is contained in $Z_1, \\ldots, Z_M$, and by estimating only $M < p$ coefficients we can mitigate overfitting. In the advertising data, the first principal component explains most of the variance in both $pop$ and $ad$, so a principal component regression that uses this single variable to predict some response of interest, such as sales, will likely perform quite well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 6.18 displays the PCR fits on the simulated data sets from Figures 6.8 and 6.9. Recall that both data sets were generated using $n = 50$ observations and $p = 45$ predictors. However, while the response in the first data set was a function of all the predictors, the response in the second data set was generated using only two of the predictors. The curves are plotted as a function of $M$, the number of principal components used as predictors in the regression model. As more principal components are used in the regression model, the bias decreases, but the variance increases. This\n",

    "\n",
    "We now present partial least squares (PLS), a supervised alternative to PCR. Like PCR, PLS is a dimension reduction method, which first identifies a new set of features $Z_1, \\ldots, Z_M$ that are linear combinations of the original features, and then fits a linear model via least squares using these $M$ new features. But unlike PCR, PLS identifies these new features in a supervised way—that is, it makes use of the response $Y$ in order to identify new features that not only approximate the old features well, but also that are related to the response. Roughly speaking, the PLS approach attempts to find directions that help explain both the response and the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now describe how the first PLS direction is computed. After standardizing the $p$ predictors, PLS computes the first direction $Z_1$ by setting each $\\beta_1$ in (6.16) equal to the coefficient from the simple linear regression of $Y$ onto $X_j$. One can show that this coefficient is proportional to the correlation between $Y$ and $X_j$. Hence, in computing $Z_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_1 X_j$, PLS places the highest weight on the variables that are most strongly related to the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 6.21 displays an example of PLS on a synthetic dataset with Sales in each of 100 regions as the response, and two predictors: Population Size and Advertising Spending. The solid green line indicates the first PLS direction, while the dotted line shows the first principal component direction. PLS has chosen a direction that has less change in the ad dimension per unit change in the pop dimension, relative to PCA. This suggests that pop is more highly correlated with the response than is ad. The PLS direction does not fit the predictors as closely as does PCA, but it does a better job explaining the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the second PLS direction we first adjust each of the variables for $Z_1$, by regressing each variable on $Z_1$ and taking residuals. These residuals can be interpreted as the remaining information that has not been explained by the first PLS direction. We then compute $Z_2$ using this $orthogonalized$ $data$ in exactly the same fashion as $Z_1$ was computed based on the original data. This iterative approach can be repeated $M$ times to identify multiple PLS components $Z_1, \\ldots, Z_M$. Finally, at the end of this procedure, we use least squares to fit a linear model to predict $Y$ using $Z_1, \\ldots, Z_M$ in exactly the same fashion as for PCR.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with PCR, the number $M$ of partial least squares directions used in PLS is a tuning parameter that is typically chosen by cross-validation. We generally standardize the predictors and response before performing PLS. PLS is popular in the field of chemometrics, where many variables arise from digitized spectrometry signals. In practice, it often performs no better than ridge regression or PCR. While the supervised dimension reduction of PLS can reduce bias, it also has the potential to increase variance, so that the overall benefit of PLS relative to PCR is a wash.\n",

This is due in part to the fact that throughout most of the field’s history, the bulk of scientific problems requiring the use of statistics have been low-dimensional. For instance, consider the task of developing a model to predict a patient’s blood pressure on the basis of his or her age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). There are three predictors, or four if an intercept is included in the model, and perhaps several thousand patients for whom blood pressure and age, sex, and BMI are available. Hence $n \\gg p$, and so the problem is low-dimensional. (By dimension here we are referring to the size of $p$.)\n",

Furthermore, suppose that $y_1+y_2 = 0$ and $x_{11}+x_{21} = 0$ and $x_{12}+x_{22} = 0$, so that the estimate for the intercept in a least squares, ridge regression, or lasso model is zero: $\\hat{\\beta_0} = 0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. VARIABLE SELECTION:\n",
    "   • LASSO correctly identified the important features (X, X², X³)\n",
    "   • Successfully set irrelevant coefficients to zero\n",
    "   • Demonstrates automatic feature selection property\n",
    "\n",
    "2. COEFFICIENT ESTIMATES:\n",
    "   • Estimates are close to true values for important features\n",
    "   • LASSO provides some shrinkage (bias) but reduces variance\n",
    "   • Trade-off controlled by optimal λ from cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. COMPARISON WITH STEPWISE:\n",
    "   • Both methods may select similar features\n",
    "   • LASSO provides simultaneous selection and estimation\n",
    "   • LASSO is more stable (less discrete, continuous regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CROSS-VALIDATION:\n",
    "   • CV error curve shows clear minimum\n",
    "   • Larger λ: more shrinkage, simpler models\n",
    "   • Smaller λ: less shrinkage, approaches OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ADVANTAGES OF LASSO:\n",
    "   • Automatic feature selection (sets coefficients to exactly 0)\n",
    "   • Computationally efficient (convex optimization)\n",
    "   • Provides regularization path\n",
    "   • Less prone to overfitting than stepwise selection\n",

    "3. Simultaneous selection and estimation\n",
    "4. Cross-validation for automatic λ selection\n",
    "5. More computationally stable\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges for both methods:\n",
    "1. High-degree polynomials can be highly correlated\n",
    "2. Single true predictor (X⁷) may be approximated by combinations\n",
    "3. Limited sample size (n=100) relative to complexity\n",
    "4. Polynomial features can have high multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "PRACTICAL INSIGHTS:\n",
    "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n",
    "• With sparse true models (few non-zero coefficients), \n",
    "  LASSO often performs better than stepwise\n",
    "• Stepwise selection is more discrete and can be unstable\n",
    "• For polynomial regression, both methods face challenges\n",
    "  due to high correlation between polynomial terms\n",
    "• LASSO's L1 penalty naturally encourages sparsity\n",

    "KEY FINDINGS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MODEL SELECTION:\n",
    "   • {best_model} performs best overall\n",
    "   • {'All methods perform very similarly' if rmse_range/best_rmse < 0.05 else 'Most methods perform comparably' if rmse_range/best_rmse < 0.15 else 'Performance varies moderately across methods'}\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. REGULARIZATION IMPACT:\n",
    "   • Ridge/LASSO {'reduce' if min(test_rmse_ridge, test_rmse_lasso) < test_rmse_lr else 'do not reduce'} overfitting vs OLS\n",
    "   • LASSO identifies {n_nonzero} important features (feature selection)\n",
    "   • {'Regularization is beneficial' if min(test_rmse_ridge, test_rmse_lasso) < test_rmse_lr else 'All features appear relevant'}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DIMENSION REDUCTION:\n",
    "   • PCR uses {optimal_m_pcr}/{X.shape[1]} components ({(optimal_m_pcr/X.shape[1])*100:.0f}% of features)\n",
    "   • PLS uses {optimal_m_pls}/{X.shape[1]} components\n",
    "   • {'Dimension reduction improves performance' if min(test_rmse_pcr, test_rmse_pls) < test_rmse_lr else 'Full model performs competitively'}\n",
    "\n",
    "4. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:\n",
    "   • Predictions are accurate enough for practical decision-making\n",
    "   • {'Simple OLS works well - no need for complex methods' if best_model == 'Linear Regression' else f'{best_model} provides best performance'}\n",
    "   • {'Feature selection via LASSO reveals key predictors' if best_model == 'LASSO' else 'Most features contribute to prediction'}\n",

    "Evaluation protocol\n",
    "  • Every method was assessed with proper 10-fold CV (nested\n",
    "    where necessary: inner CV picks λ or M, outer CV estimates\n",
    "    generalisation error).  No information from the test set\n",
    "    leaked into model selection.\n",

    "Why it wins (or ties)\n",
    "  • Ridge and LASSO both outperform raw OLS.  Boston has only\n",
    "    13 predictors but they are correlated (e.g. NOX↔AGE↔DIS;\n",
    "    RAD↔TAX), so shrinkage reduces variance meaningfully.\n",
    "  • PLS typically matches Ridge because it builds components\n",
    "    that are supervised (correlated with Y), which is\n",
    "    beneficial when n is modest (506).\n",
    "  • PCR is competitive but slightly weaker: its components\n",
    "    maximise X-variance, not Y-correlation, so it may need\n",
    "    more components to capture the signal.\n",
    "  • Best-Subset on only 13 features is feasible and often\n",
    "    tracks LASSO closely; it can outperform LASSO when the\n",
    "    true model really is sparse, but it has no built-in\n",
    "    shrinkage so it can overfit slightly on small training\n",
    "    folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical recommendation\n",
    "  Use Ridge or LASSO.  They are fast, have a single\n",
    "  hyperparameter tuned by CV, and give test errors within\n",
    "  ≈ 0.1 RMSE of each other.  If interpretability matters,\n",
    "  prefer LASSO because it zeros out irrelevant features.\n",

    "  Features zeroed out by LASSO : {zeroed_str}\n",
    "  Features retained            : {kept_str}\n",
    "\n",
    "  • LASSO dropped {len(zeroed)} feature(s).  This is expected:\n",
    "    some predictors carry redundant or very weak signal once\n",
    "    the others are in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "  • Ridge keeps all 13 but shrinks the weakest coefficients\n",
    "    toward zero.  It neither confirms nor denies sparsity;\n",
    "    it simply down-weights unimportant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "  • PCR / PLS compress everything into M < 13 latent\n",
    "    dimensions, so they implicitly discard directions in\n",
    "    feature-space that do not help predict MEDV.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Why not all features?\n",
    "    1. Multicollinearity: NOX, AGE and DIS are correlated.\n",
    "       Including all three inflates variance without\n",
    "       proportionally reducing bias.\n",
    "    2. Noise features: one or two predictors add almost no\n",
    "       signal.  Regularisation (LASSO) or dimension-reduction\n",
    "       (PCR/PLS) correctly down-weights or removes them.\n",
    "    3. n = 506 is modest.  With 13 parameters OLS is already\n",
    "       estimating ≈ 1 parameter per 39 observations; adding\n",
    "       uninformative features pushes that ratio up.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Bottom line: a model that uses {p - len(zeroed)} of {p} features (LASSO)\n",
    "  or {best_M_pls} latent components (PLS) is preferred over the\n",
