    " The linear regression model discussed in Chapter 3 assumes that the re\n",
    "sponse variable Y is quantitative. But in many situations, the response\n",
    " variable is instead qualitative. For example, eye color is qualitative. Of- qualitative\n",
    " ten qualitative variables are referred to as categorical; we will use these\n",
    " terms interchangeably. In this chapter, we study approaches for predicting\n",
    " qualitative responses, a process that is known as classification. Predicting classification\n",
    " a qualitative response for an observation can be referred to as classifying\n",
    " that observation, since it involves assigning the observation to a category,\n",
    " or class. On the other hand, often the methods used for classification first\n",
    " predict the probability that the observation belongs to each of the cate\n",
    "gories of a qualitative variable, as the basis for making the classification.\n",
    " In this sense they also behave like regression methods.\n",
    " There are many possible classification techniques, or classifiers, that one classifier\n",
    " might use to predict a qualitative response. We touched on some of these\n",
    " in Sections 2.1.5 and 2.2.3. In this chapter we discuss some widely-used\n",
    " classifiers: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic dis- logistic\n",
    " criminant analysis, naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbors. The discussion\n",

    " Classification problems occur often, perhaps even more so than regression problems. Some examples include:\n",
    "  1. A person arrives at the emergency room with a set of symptoms\n",
    " that could possibly be attributed to one of three medical conditions.\n",
    " Which of the three conditions does the individual have?\n",
    " 2. An online banking service must be able to determine whether or not\n",
    " a transaction being performed on the site is fraudulent, on the basis\n",
    " of the user’s IP address, past transaction history, and so forth.\n",
    " 3. On the basis of DNA sequence data for a number of patients with\n",
    " and without a given disease, a biologist would like to figure out which\n",
    " DNA mutations are deleterious (disease-causing) and which are not.\n",
    "\n",
    " Just as in the regression setting, in the classification setting we have a\n",
    " set of training observations (x1,y1),...,(xn,yn) that we can use to build\n",
    " a classifier. We want our classifier to perform well not only on the training\n",
    " data, but also on test observations that were not used to train the classifier.\n",
    " \n",
    " In this chapter, we will illustrate the concept of classification using the\n",
    " simulated Default data set. We are interested in predicting whether an\n",
    " individual will default on his or her credit card payment, on the basis of\n",
    " annual income and monthly credit card balance. The data set is displayed\n",
    " in Figure 4.1. In the left-hand panel of Figure 4.1, we have plotted annual\n",
    " income and monthly credit card balance for a subset of 10,000 individuals.\n",
    " The individuals who defaulted in a given month are shown in orange, and\n",
    " those who did not in blue. (The overall default rate is about 3%, so we\n",
    " have plotted only a fraction of the individuals who did not default.) It\n",
    " appears that individuals who defaulted tended to have higher credit card\n",
    " balances than those who did not. In the center and right-hand panels of\n",
    " Figure 4.1, two pairs of boxplots are shown. The first shows the distribution\n",
    " of balance split by the binary default variable; the second is a similar plot\n",
    " for income. In this chapter, we learn how to build a model to predict default\n",
    " (Y ) for any given value of balance (X1) and income (X2). Since Y is not\n",
    " quantitative, the simple linear regression model of Chapter 3 is not a good\n",
    " choice: we will elaborate on this further in Section 4.2.\n",
    " \n",
    " It is worth noting that Figure 4.1 displays a very pronounced relation\n",
    "ship between the predictor balance and the response default. In most real\n",
    " applications, the relationship between the predictor and the response will\n",
    " not be nearly so strong. However, for the sake of illustrating the classifica\n",
    "tion procedures discussed in this chapter, we use an example in which the\n",
    " relationship between the predictor and the response is somewhat exaggerated."
