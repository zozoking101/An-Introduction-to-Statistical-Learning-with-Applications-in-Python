    "• First of all, training error rates will usually be lower than test error\n",
    "rates, which are the real quantity of interest. In other words, we\n",
    "might expect this classifier to perform worse if we use it to predict\n",
    "whether or not a new set of individuals will default. The reason is\n",
    "that we specifically adjust the parameters of our model to do well on\n",
    "the training data. The higher the ratio of parameters p to number\n",
    "of samples n, the more we expect this overfitting to play a role. For overfitting\n",

    "• Second, since only 3.33% of the individuals in the training sample\n",
    "defaulted, a simple but useless classifier that always predicts that\n",
    "an individual will not default, regardless of his or her credit card\n",
    "balance and student status, will result in an error rate of 3.33%. In\n",
    "other words, the trivial null classifier will achieve an error rate that null\n",
    "is only a bit higher than the LDA training set error rate.\n",
    "In practice, a binary classifier such as this one can make two types of\n",
    "errors: it can incorrectly assign an individual who defaults to the no default\n",
    "category, or it can incorrectly assign an individual who does not default to the default category. It is often of interest to determine which of these two\n",
    "types of errors are being made. A confusion matrix, shown for the Default confusion\n",
    "data in Table 4.4, is a convenient way to display this information. The\n",
    "table reveals that LDA predicted that a total of 104 people would default.\n",
    "Of these people, 81 actually defaulted and 23 did not. Hence only 23 out\n",
    "of 9,667 of the individuals who did not default were incorrectly labeled.\n",
    "This looks like a pretty low error rate! However, of the 333 individuals who\n",
    "defaulted, 252 (or 75.7%) were missed by LDA. So while the overall error\n",
    "rate is low, the error rate among individuals who defaulted is very high.\n",
    "From the perspective of a credit card company that is trying to identify\n",
