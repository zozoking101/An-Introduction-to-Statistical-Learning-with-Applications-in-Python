    "an individual will not default, regardless of his or her credit card\n",

    "for which this quantity is largest. Unlike in (4.24), the quantity x appears\n",
    "as a quadratic function in (4.28). This is where QDA gets its name.\n",
    "Whydoes it matter whether or not we assume that the K classes share a\n",
    "common covariance matrix? In other words, why would one prefer LDA to QDA, or vice-versa? The answer lies in the bias-variance trade-off. When\n",

    "ing that the K classes share a common covariance matrix, the LDA model\n",
    "becomes linear in x, which means there are Kp linear coefficients to esti\n",
    "mate. Consequently, LDA is a much less flexible classifier than QDA, and\n",
    "so has substantially lower variance. This can potentially lead to improved\n",
    "prediction performance. But there is a trade-off: if LDA’s assumption that\n",
